    #1 Call me bias - I‚Äôve built a career out of creating the influence culture ‚Äî but gahhh I love social media.
    + You‚Äôll never hear me dumbing down the incredible times we live in via our digital village square here.
    I love creatives, they are my muse.
    AND what crushes me most is when they connect the value of their expression, with a machine‚Äôs idea of worthy content.
    üíÉüèºYour audience has evolved as well, it‚Äôs not just you.
    üíØIf you‚Äôre craving expansive, honest, human, original, unique, Real ways of sharing ‚Äî your audience is too.
    Keep coming back to your uniqueness, your one-of-a-kind essence.
    In honoring your expression of Self, you empowers others to do the very same too.

# Competence Confidence Loop:

The more you attempt, learn, and improve at things, the more confidence you gain. The loop starts over again.

# Drop the Self-Doubt and Negative Self-Talk

    ## Double down on what you're good at
