    #1 Call me bias - I‚Äôve built a career out of creating the influence culture ‚Äî but gahhh I love social media.
    + You‚Äôll never hear me dumbing down the incredible times we live in via our digital village square here.
    I love creatives, they are my muse.
    AND what crushes me most is when they connect the value of their expression, with a machine‚Äôs idea of worthy content.

The more you attempt, learn, and improve at things, the more confidence you gain. The loop starts over again.
